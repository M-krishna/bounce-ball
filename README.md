# Bounce ball
Trying to implement gravity, friction, velocity and so on.

## How to run?
* Setup raylib
    * Clone the raylib repo
    * Build the source and it'll give "libraylib.a" and "raylib.h"
    * Copy over those two files into this repo
* To compile and run use `make my_app`
* To run use `make run`
